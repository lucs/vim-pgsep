I like to put "page separator" lines in my files. These are special
lines that this plugin is made to navigate to. I can do a ｢Page down｣
or ｢Page up｣ and the plugin will scroll the text so that the next or
previous page separator line and the cursor are placed at the top of
the screen. I can also ｢Insert｣ a separator line where the cursor
happens to be. You can define your own separator lines or use one of
the supplied ones.
